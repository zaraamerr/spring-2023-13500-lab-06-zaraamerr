* Specific instructions for lab 06

This lab requires that you implement doctest based tests. There is
already a skeleton ~Makefile~ with targets for ~main~ and ~tests~ as
well as skeleton ~.c~ ~.h~ and ~doctest.h~ files. 

** Task A

For Task A, create a file test-ascii.cpp as specified in the main
lab. There should be a target in your Makefile *test-ascii* which will
build test-ascii.cpp into an executable named *test-ascii*. This file should have its own main and you should not use doctest to test it.

** Tasks B - D

***  Task B

Write the functions required for task B in a files named *caesar.cpp*
and *caeser.h*. You will have to change the Makefile accordingly. Also
note that this repository starts with funcs.cpp/funcs.h. You won't be
using those files but can use them and the Makefile as a starting
point.

Make sure to put sufficient doctest tests for the two functions in tests.cpp. 

For reference, the doctest package and documentation can be found
[[https://github.com/onqtam/doctest][here]].



*Note:* Remember that your program (including tests) should not ask
 for any keyboard input. When run it should clearly show that all
 tasks are implemented and work.


*** Task C

Write the functions for Task C in files named *vigenere.cpp* and
*vigenere.h*. Once again, modify the other files as necessary and
write sufficient tests in *tests.cpp*.

*** Task D

Write the functions for Task D in files named *decrypt.cpp* and
*decrypt.h* Once again, modify the other files as necessary and
write sufficient tests in *tests.cpp*.
